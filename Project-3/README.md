# Project 3 - RideForce - PWA Conversion
RideForce, previously RideShare, is a ride coordinating application for Revature Associates. All associates can create an account on the first day of training with a temporary access token generated by the app upon request of the trainer. A user who wants to offer rides can register a car with their account. Any associates who need a ride can coordinate with drivers who have registered cars based on proximity and preference.
My Responsibilities for this iteration of the project were mainly to convert the website to a Progressive Web Application. I used Google’s Lighthouse auditing tool to assess the website for important PWA features like having the webpage implement a Service Worker, be installable, and be served on HTTPS. Once I had completed converting the website to a PWA, I spent the majority of my time optimizing the webpage for performance.
## Performance Optimizations
 * Text Minimization - Used Webpack to minimize the JavaScript code during the build process.
 * Text Compression - Configured Amazon Cloudfront to host the webpage on HTTPS and compress the files into a gzip file format.
 * Serving images in “next-gen” format - Converted the larger images into Google’s webp format.
 * Preloading Render-Blocking Resources - Moved important fonts that are used on the landing page into their own CSS file so that they will be loaded early.
 * Defer unnecessary scripts in the index.html - The previous iterations loaded all of the resources in the index.html, I deferred the unused resources so that they won’t slow down performance.
 * Splitting the app.module - The previous iterations only used one module to load all of the resources and dependencies. I split the module into two modules, one has only the necessary components for the landing page, the other has all the remaining components and dependencies. 
## Audit Results
I have included Images that demonstrate the progress that was made. The Before_Audit and After_Audit show the progress that was made during this iteration. The PWA_Audit shows the checklist that Lighthouse generates when evaluating a Progressive Web App. Additionally, the only checkbox that was marked off was the “Does not use HTTPS” which is caused by the fact that the EC2 was not hosted on HTTPS, but this is in progress of being implemented by the service administrator.
