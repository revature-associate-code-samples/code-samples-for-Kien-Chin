#Project 0 - Banking Application
Project 0 is a console-based banking application that is designed to handle realistic interactions with a bank. The application has two roles, users and admins. Users are allowed to create accounts or log into existing accounts with a username and password. Admins are capable of viewing all new users and activating or deactivating the users accounts. Once a user is logged into an account, they have the ability to create banking accounts like checking or savings accounts, as well as withdrawals, deposits, and transfers between accounts.
